What is it
===========
Simple single-file C++ program that implements data structures for
hidden markov models and two algorithms (Viterbi for most likely
sequence of hidden states and forward-backward for caclulating
the probability of the state).


Implementation note
===================
External dependencies (logging, build system, libraries) are
evaded on purpose to provide pure implementation and make it
easier to build and run for demonstration purposes.
